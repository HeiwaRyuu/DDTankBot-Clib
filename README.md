# DDTankBot-Clib
This is a bot for farming different types of content in the game DDTank
I'm currently developing it's features, but basically it will be able to solo farm any expedition and also self farm PvP's (for missions and drops)

Already found pointers to player's:<\br>
1 - X and Y position<\br>
2 - Player's Life
3 - Stamina
4 - Shot Force
5 - Last Round Shot Force
6 - Round (1 if player turn, otherwise 0)

Also found position AOB for any objetic in a map, currently using it to filter enemy X and Y position (80% consistent)

Currently having a hard time finding a way to fetch the current wind value consistently...
